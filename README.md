## Background
We looked at world energy data from 1990-2020 for 44 countries. Energy types include: CO2 emissions, total energy consumption, natural gas production, electricity consumption, wind/solar energy, and coal ignition production. 

We are looking at how energy consumption has changed by country, over time. This is important because it will reveal not only the present state of energy consumption, but can be used to predict the future of different types of energy consumption. We can use historical benchmarks (2016 Paris Agreement, Covid pandemic, cryptocurrency data mining) to predict when potential outliers/trends have occurred. 

Energy is needed to power our world but, as we know, climate change and lasting effects on the health of the living beings have devastating effects. Analyzing and understanding energy trends will allow us to shape the future of our planetâ€™s health. 

## Questions We Explored
1. How do countries differ in terms of energy consumption and production over time? 
2. Has the Paris Agreement had an impact on energy use?
3. Did other historical benchmarks impact energy consumption (covid pandemic, cryptocurrency datamining)?
4. What countries are producing the most renewable electricity?

## Key Findings
Could look at 1 or 2 of each of our findings to make a story tying into the above background

## Support
We used a variety of sources and information to complete this project. First and foremost, we shared code amongst ourselves while troubleshooting issues and writing the code. We attended class, watched class recordings, utilized tutoring sessions and office hours, and did a lot of online searching for this challenge assignment. One online resource we used was several YouTube video tutorials outlining using D3 for interactive charts and edited the text to fit the needs for the Renewable Electricity chart. The video series was created by "Data Science for Everyone".
