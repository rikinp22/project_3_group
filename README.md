# World Energy Trends (1990-2020)
Group Project #3

Team: Jiamin Li, Anuja Panthari, Kelsey Brantner, Rikin Patel, and Laura Jordan

## Background
Our dataset includes world energy data from 1990-2020 for 44 countries. Energy types captured include CO2 emissions, total energy consumption, natural gas production, electricity consumption, wind/solar energy, and coal ignition production. We will be looking at how energy consumption and production has changed by country, over time. This is important because it will reveal not only the present state of energy consumption, but can be used to predict the future of different types of energy consumption. We can use historical benchmarks (2016 Paris Agreement, Covid pandemic) to predict when potential outliers/trends have occurred. 

Energy is needed to power our world, but (as we know), climate change and lasting effects on the health of the living beings have devastating effects. Analyzing and understanding energy trends will allow us to shape the future of our planet’s health. 

## Dataset
The data set used for this project can be found at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shub218/energy-data-1990-2020?select=Energy+data+1990+-+2020.csv

## Questions and Key Findings
1. How’s energy production and consumption changing year over year?
   * The total energy production have increased by 58% from 7,851 mtoe to 12,375 mtoe.
   * The total energy consumption have increased by 57% from 7,635 mtoe to 11,968 mtoe.
   * For reference: the population increased by 46% and global GDP soar up by 235% for the last 3 decades. 
2. How do energy trends differ between fossil fuel type?
   * Across the 30 years, US, Russia, India and China had the highest overall consumption across all fossil fuel energy types.
   * Oil and natural gas increased over time for most countries.
   * Coal consumption increased over time only for China and India.
3. What has been the impact of the Paris Agreement?
   * Will need Kelsey to complete
4. Has any recent historical event severely impacted energy/electricity consumption?
   * Will need Rikin to complete
5. Which countries are producing the most renewable electricity?
   * Norway has the highest percentage of electricity produced using renewable resources. Norway had 98.37% of their electricity pruced from renewables (hydro, wind, geothermal and solar).
   * Brazil and New Zealand also had very high percentages of their electricity produced using renewable resources.
Brazil: 84.1%
New Zealand: 80.01%

## Support
To complete this assignment, we attended class, reviewed notes, attended office hours and utilized tutoring sessions. We also consulted, troubleshot and shared code amongst the team. Additionally, we used outside sources for assistance. One resource that was heavily consulted for part of this project was the YouTube channel Data Science for Everyone. 

## Submission Includes 
* Will complete where TAs can find all final code once we are fully finished loading items to GitHub
* Proposal:
* SQL:
* Flask:
* Final Code and HTML:
